    Programming and chess are two of my greatest passions. They may seem like vastly different pursuits, but to me, they share a common thread: the pursuit of creativity, logic, and strategy.
Programming is where I have put my creative energies for the larger part of my life. From developing small video games using the Unity engine to playing around with math puzzles using languages such as Python and C, I have always been fascinated by the power of code to create something from nothing. I have a strong desire to study computer science because witnessing its advancement, from something that was at first the size of a room to something that nowadays can effortlessly fit in oneâ€™s pocket, is unimaginable. Every day, I challenge myself to imagine new possible solutions for real-world problems and create them by writing new lines of code. I don't want to change the world. I want to change the way we interact with it, and programming is a good way to accomplish it.
On the other hand, chess is a game of strategy, logic, and creativity. It is a game that has been played for centuries and has stood the test of time. Chess is not just a game; it is a way of life. It teaches us to think ahead, to plan, and to strategize. It is a game that requires patience, concentration, and discipline. Chess is a game that is both simple and complex, and it is this paradox that makes it so fascinating to me.
Programming and chess may seem like two different worlds, but to me, they are two sides of the same coin. Both require creativity, logic, and strategy. Both require patience, concentration, and discipline. Both are pursuits that have the power to change the world in their own unique ways.
In conclusion, my passion for programming and chess is rooted in my love for creativity, logic, and strategy. These two pursuits have taught me to think critically, to plan ahead, and to never give up. They have taught me that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.
